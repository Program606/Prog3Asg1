# I'm most likely missing some stuff but here's the really big stuff

# Main Things to Make (goes in the A1 class probably)

- Clean up String Method
- Creator: [insert name here]
  - trim leading and trailing spaces
  - string.toLowerCase()
  - no apostrophes (remove any text that follows it as well)
  - no punctuation or digits

- Add Hero Method (or check hero) could be two methods we'll see ig
- Creator: [insert name here]
  - call this after clean-up
  - check to see if the hero already exists
  - either add it to an existing hero object or make a new hero object and update the counts

- loadData() method?? Idk how exactly feeding it into the terminal works 
    
## A1 Class  
  - PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN (String[] args)...
  - A1.run()
  - Scanner object
  - arraylist of avenger (see toy class from last semester as an idea)

## Comparator class 
- break your ties here
    
## This would probably all be inside Avenger.java class or something
  - Setters and Getters for ... (all are private)
  - Creator:
    - get/set heroAlias (IronMan)
    - get/set heroName (stark)
    - get/set performer (Downey)
    - get/set naemFreq
    - get/set performerFreq

- natural ordering
- **COMPARABLE**
    - override equals and toString
   
  - toString() into the output.txt
  - Creator:
    - **please look at master document for full guidelines**
    - String format = heroAlias + " aka " + heroName
     + " performed by " + performer
     + " mentioned "
     + "(n: " + nameFreq
     + " + a: " + aliasFreq
     + " + p: " + performerFreq
     + ")" + " time(s)";
